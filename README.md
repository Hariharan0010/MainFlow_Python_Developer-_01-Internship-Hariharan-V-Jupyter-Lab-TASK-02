# Python Developer Internship - Task 2: Sample Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Overview

Welcome to my second task as a Python Developer intern at **Main Flow Services and Technologies**. This task focuses on exploring basic data analysis techniques using the Pandas library in Python. 

## Description

In this task, I have worked on several foundational data analysis skills using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. The task is designed to improve my ability to handle, clean, and manipulate data efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

- **Reading and Manipulating Data:** Understanding how to read CSV files and manipulate DataFrames using Pandas.
- **Data Cleaning:** Performing data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- **Data Manipulation:** Practicing data manipulation operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping data.

## Repository Structure

- **`Task2.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for this task.
- **`sample_data.csv`**: A sample dataset used for data analysis tasks.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing the Python packages required to run the notebook.
- **`README.md`**: This README file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library
- NumPy library

You can install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-developer-internship.git
   cd python-developer-internship/Task2
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open and Run `Task2.ipynb`:**

   - Open the `Task2.ipynb` file in your Jupyter Notebook interface.
   - Run the cells in the notebook to see the data analysis tasks in action.

## Key Highlights

Here are some key features and functions implemented in this task:

- **Reading Data:**
  - Used `pd.read_csv()` to import data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
  
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handled missing values using functions like `fillna()` and `dropna()`.
  - Removed duplicates with `drop_duplicates()`.

- **Data Manipulation:**
  - Filtered data based on specific conditions.
  - Sorted data using `sort_values()`.
  - Grouped data and performed aggregations with `groupby()`.

## Conclusion

This task has significantly improved my understanding of data manipulation and analysis using Pandas. It has equipped me with practical skills to handle data more effectively and prepared me for more advanced data analysis tasks.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank **Main Flow Services and Technologies** for providing me with this learning opportunity and guiding me through this data analysis task.
